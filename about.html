    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      The Air Quality Monitoring System is a web-based platform designed to track and display real-time environmental data such as air pollution levels (PM2.5, PM10, CO2) and weather conditions (temperature, humidity).
    </p>
    <p>
      By using smart sensors and modern web technologies, this system provides users with accurate and live insights about the air they breatheâ€”helping raise awareness and support better environmental decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Features:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Live air quality index updates based on location</li>
        <li>Weather information like temperature & humidity</li>
        <li>Interactive visualizations (graphs, pie charts)</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface for all age groups</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sensor APIs, possibly Node.js or Python for backend integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to increase awareness about air pollution and help users make informed decisions about their health and environment.
